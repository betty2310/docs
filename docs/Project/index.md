I keep a development log for some of the project I'm working on, you can find them here:

+ [FOMATEM](https://github.com/betty2310/FOMATEM): an **FO**ootballer **MA**nager Sy**tem** app.

Most of my other projects doesn't have a DEVLOG, but please feel free to check them on [GitHub](https://github.com/betty2310?tab=repositories).
