Yeah, actually this is the first time I have built (or must :v) an application - Footballer management system. For more infomation, see [my repo](https://github.com/betty2310/FOMATEM) on github.

This app build by Java and JavaFX. I also used SceneBuilder to desgin the molkitt.

Well, my idea is each object in sidebar, when click will open a menu to control query.
Then, query database, get ouput to another scene.
