Handle click on each object on sidebar today. Ex, if u click `Student`, right pane side will be menu of student, not club or coach. 

So, how to do it. I learn from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPF3qGTjYgk), the solution is: 

+ create stackpane.
+ each right pane will push in this stackpane. And if I click, i push this pane to top, it will show exactly.

And, as many stuff I coded before :v, add some beatiful components only for fun. 


As u can see, in right bottom pane is a query button. Then, tomorrow's work is handle click on this button, and another scene will show. This scene will show data from database. But first thing to do is connect to database :v.

U can see [Video demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HYPcAPtblOWuMdWL5U1l9ZkE9YWQfcoQ/view?usp=sharing") here.
